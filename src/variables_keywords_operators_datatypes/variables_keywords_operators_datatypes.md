Variables, data types, reserved words, and operators in Java:

1. Variables:
    - Variables in Java are used to store data that can be manipulated or accessed throughout the program.
    - To declare a variable, you specify the type followed by the variable name. For example: `int age;` declares an integer variable called `age`.
    - Variables can be assigned values using the assignment operator (`=`). For example: `age = 25;`.
    - Variables can also be initialized at the time of declaration. For example: `int count = 0;`.
    - Variable names should follow certain rules, such as starting with a letter, being case-sensitive, and not using reserved words.

2. Data Types:
    - Java supports two categories of data types: primitive types and (non-primitive)reference types.
      - Primitive types
      
   |Data Type	|Default Value	|Default size|Range|
   |------------|----------------|-----------|-----|
   |boolean	|false	|1 bit|NA|
   |char	|'\u0000'	|2 byte|'\u0000' to '\uffff'|
   |byte	|0	|1 byte|-128 to 127|
   |short	|0	|2 byte|-32,768 to 32,767|
   |int	|0	|4 byte|-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647|
   |long	|0L	|8 byte|-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807|
   |float	|0.0f	|4 byte|-3.4E38 to 3.4E38|
   |double	|0.0d	|8 byte|-1.7E308 to 1.7E308|

3. Reserved Words:
    - Reserved words, also known as keywords, are predefined words in Java that have specific meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, class names, etc.).
    - It is important to avoid using reserved words as variable or class names to prevent conflicts and errors in your code.
    
   |Reserved Words| | | | 
   |--------------|---|---|---| 
   |abstract|assert|boolean|break|
   |byte|case|catch|char|class|
   |const|continue|default|do|
   |double|else|enum|extends|
   |final|finally|float|for|
   |goto|if|implements|import|
   |instanceof|int|interface|long|
   |native|new|package|private|
   |protected|public|return|short|
   |static|strictfp|super|switch|
   |synchronized|this|throw|throws|
   |transient|try|void|volatile|
   |while||||
