Set implementation in Java:

1. HashSet:
    - HashSet is a collection that does not allow duplicate elements.
    - It uses a hash table to store elements, so the retrieval time is generally constant (O(1)) for most operations.
    - It does not maintain any specific order of elements.

2. LinkedHashSet:
    - LinkedHashSet is similar to HashSet but maintains the order of elements based on their insertion.
    - It uses a hash table for storing elements and a linked list to maintain the order of insertion.
    - As a result, the elements are ordered in the same sequence as they were added.

3. SortedSet:
    - SortedSet is an interface in Java that extends the Set interface and enforces ordering of elements.
    - It ensures that the elements are always sorted according to their natural ordering (if they implement Comparable) or a custom comparator provided at the time of creation.

4. TreeSet:
    - TreeSet is a concrete implementation of the SortedSet interface.
    - It stores elements in a red-black tree, which ensures that elements are always in sorted order.
    - TreeSet allows efficient retrieval of elements in sorted order (ascending or descending).

Here's an example demonstrating the usage of HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SetExamples {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // HashSet example
        Set<String> hashSet = new HashSet<>();
        hashSet.add("apple");
        hashSet.add("banana");
        hashSet.add("orange");
        hashSet.add("banana"); // Duplicate, won't be added
        System.out.println("HashSet: " + hashSet);

        // LinkedHashSet example
        Set<String> linkedHashSet = new LinkedHashSet<>();
        linkedHashSet.add("apple");
        linkedHashSet.add("banana");
        linkedHashSet.add("orange");
        linkedHashSet.add("banana"); // Duplicate, won't be added
        System.out.println("LinkedHashSet: " + linkedHashSet);

        // TreeSet example
        Set<String> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();
        treeSet.add("apple");
        treeSet.add("banana");
        treeSet.add("orange");
        treeSet.add("banana"); // Duplicate, won't be added
        System.out.println("TreeSet: " + treeSet);
    }
}
```

Output:
```
HashSet: [orange, banana, apple]
LinkedHashSet: [apple, banana, orange]
TreeSet: [apple, banana, orange]
```


### `HashSet` vs `LinkedHashSet` vs `TreeSet` 

| Characteristic        | HashSet                          | LinkedHashSet                         | TreeSet                     |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Duplicate Elements   | Does not allow duplicate elements| Does not allow duplicate elements    | Does not allow duplicate elements    |
| Order of Elements    | Does not maintain insertion order | Maintains insertion order             | Sorted in natural order (ascending) |
| Backed Data Structure| Hash Table                       | Hash Table + Linked List (insertion order) | Red-Black Tree             |
| Sorting              | Not sorted                        | Not sorted                            | Sorted in natural order (ascending) |
| Memory Overhead      | Less                             | Slightly more                        | More                        |
| Use Cases            | General purpose                  | Maintaining insertion order            | Sorted data and searching    |

Keep in mind that the choice of the Set implementation depends on the specific requirements of your application. If you need a Set that does not allow duplicates and offers constant-time retrieval but doesn't need to maintain insertion order, use `HashSet`. If you require a Set that maintains the order of elements based on insertion order, use `LinkedHashSet`. If you need a Set that maintains elements in sorted order, use `TreeSet`.

Additionally, remember that `TreeSet` provides sorting but requires additional time and memory overhead due to maintaining a balanced binary tree. If the requirement is primarily focused on quick insertion, deletion, and retrieval, `HashSet` or `LinkedHashSet` is generally a better choice.
