Here's a comparison table highlighting the main differences between `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `Vector`, and `Stack` in Java:

|               | ArrayList                     | LinkedList                    | Vector                          | Stack                          |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Data Structure| Dynamic Array                 | Doubly-Linked List            | Dynamic Array (Synchronized)    | Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)   |
| Thread-Safe   | No                            | No                            | Yes                             | Yes                            |
| Performance   | Fast random access            | Fast insertion and deletion   | Slower than ArrayList          | Slower than ArrayList          |
|              | Slower insertion and deletion | Slower random access          | Due to synchronization         | Due to synchronization         |
|              |                            |                               |                             |                                |

| Interface     | List                          | List                          | List                            | Extends Vector                |
|              |                              |                              | Stack (Stack is a subclass)     |                                |

Note:
- `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, and `Vector` are part of the Java Collections Framework and implement the `List` interface.
- `Vector` and `Stack` are legacy classes, and it is generally recommended to use `ArrayList` and `Deque` (Double-ended queue) implementations like `ArrayDeque` instead of `Vector` and `Stack` for most modern use cases.
